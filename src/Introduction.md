# Introduction

This is a detailed tutorial for making a full stack app using Python for the backend and react for the front end.  This tutorial will cover nearly every part of the process nearly line by line at the end of which you should have a fully functional app and a solid understanding of the basics of a full stack development process.

Disclaimer: I am learning most of these skills as I write this tutorial.  Please give any [feed back](#Feedback) to help me fix mistakes.

I was inspired to make this as when I was trying to learn these skill I had to keep jumping back and forth between and bunch of different tutorials that all covered small parts of the process and then had to fill in the gaps myself.  I wanted to make a tutorial that covered *everything* so that it could be used as a all in one resource (at least if you are using this stack)

# Covered Topics

As this tutorial shows nearly every step of creating a full web based api and app there are many tools involved.  This is a list of most of the tools that will be used.  There is no guarantee that the tutorial will cover them in detail, but it will explain how to use them in service of this project.

- Git
- VScode
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- SQLalchamy
- Pytest
- Numpy docs/sphinx
- UV
- uvicorn
- Docker
- React
- Next
- More?

# App Overview

The app that this tutorial will show is DK app, DK is my and my partners initials.  I wanted to make an app that we could use as a synced grocery list, and started adding features like todo lists, recipes, budgets and more.

The app has to main parts.  The backend is a python server using fastapi running on a uvicorn serving in a docker image.  This will take web requests to save or request data.  The frontend will be a website in react and hopefully an app in react native that can be used to access the grocery list, todo list etc...

The complete app can be found here: LINK
