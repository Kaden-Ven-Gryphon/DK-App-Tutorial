# UV

UV is going to be our python package/version manager of choice.

[UV Website](https://astral.sh/blog/uv)

This is where you can download UV, and learn more about it.  UV lets your create a isolated version of python for our project and can add and remove dependences for us and manage tools like pytest.  There is not to much more to say about it, but now with this we can begin setting of the server side of the project.
